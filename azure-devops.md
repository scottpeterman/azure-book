- **Learn** how Azure DevOps can provide a streamlined DevOps pipeline
- **Sign up** for a free Azure DevOps account
- **Create** a new project in Azure DevOps

Having a streamlined development and deployment strategy can:

- **Reduce** delays in delivering features and avoid cost overruns
- **Allow** teams to be more effecient with limited resources
- **Generate** detailed and accurate performance metrics

## DevOps definition

> DevOps eliminates Development and Operation working in silos
It creates multidisciplinary teams that work together with shared and efficient practices and tools


- **Agile planning**, Ensure a prioritized backlog of work is available for the team and facilitate management for work including user stories, bugs, and more
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**, The process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**, The process to build, test, configure, and deploy from a build to a production environment.
- **Monitoring**, Use telemetry to deliver information about an applicationâ€™s performance and usage patterns to aid learning as we iterate.

Comparing _elite performers_ to _low performers_:
- do **46 times** more frequent code deployments
- have **2,555 times** faster lead time from commit to deploy
- benefit from **seven times** lower change failure rate
- recover from incidents **2,604 times** faster

Some important points:

- **DevOps improves software delivery**, which increases competitive advantages, This enables companies to experiment with increasing customer adoption and satisfaction. Leads to better organizational performance, and often higher profitability & market share. Agility allows companies to respond to competitive threats, and pivot more quickly to keep up with compliance and regulatory requirements
- **How you implement cloud infrastructure matters**, The cloud improves software delivery performance and teams that adopt essential cloud characteristics are **23 times** more likely to be high performers
- **Open-source software improves performance**, High performers are 1.75 times more likely to extensively use open-source software. They are also 1.5 times more likely to expand open-source usage in future
