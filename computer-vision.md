#Â Computer Vision API

The Computer Vision API provides algorithms to process images and return insights. For example, you can find out if an image has `mature content`, or can use it to `find all the faces` in an image. It also has other features like `estimating dominant and accent colors`, `categorizing the content of images`, and `describing an image with complete English sentences`. Additionally, it can also intelligently `generate images thumbnails` for displaying large images effectively.
