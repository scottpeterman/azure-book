#Azure functions

- Decide if serverless computing is right for your business need.
- Create an Azure function app in the Azure portal.
- Execute a function using triggers.
- Monitor and test your Azure function from the Azure portal.

Serverless compute can be thought of as a function as a service (FaaS), or a microservice that is hosted on a cloud platform. 
- Your business logic runs as functions 
- you don't have to manually provision or scale infrastructure. 
- The cloud provider manages infrastructure. 
- Your app is automatically scaled out or down depending on load.
