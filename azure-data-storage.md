You're looking for a storage solution that is `secure`, `durable`, `scalable`, and easily `accessible` from across the globe.

Thinking about storing data in the cloud.

Concerns: `security`, `backup`, and `disaster recovery` and `manage` cloud-hosted data

- **Automated backup and recovery**: mitigates the risk of losing your data if there is any unforeseen failure or interruption.
- **Replication across the globe**: copies your data to protect it against any planned or unplanned events, such as scheduled maintenance or hardware failures. You can choose to replicate your data at multiple locations across the globe.
- **Support for data analytics**: supports performing analytics on your data consumption.
- **Encryption capabilities**: data is encrypted to make it highly secure; you also have tight control over who can access the data.
- **Multiple data types**: Azure can store almost any type of data you need. It can handle video files, text files, and even large binary files like virtual hard disks. It also has many options for your relational and NoSQL data.
- **Data storage in virtual disks**: Azure also has the capability of storing up to 8 TB of data in its virtual disks. This is a significant capability when you're storing heavy data such as videos and simulations.
- **Storage tiers**: storage tiers to prioritize access to data based on frequently used versus rarely used information.
